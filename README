 This code is designed to take 2 CHGCAR files generated by VASP, and find the differences in the charge density. This code is inspired by looking at simulations of systems where you have either added or removed charge. Therefore by using this code, you can see where there is excess or an absence of charge in your cell. 
 
 TO RUN PROGRAM:
     
     cd src
     make
     cd ..
     ./deltacharge CHGCAR1 CHGCAR2
     
where CHGCAR1 and CHGCAR2 are your different CHGCAR files. The output data files that will be generated in the directory 'output' consist of: 

- 3D charge difference '3D_charge_diff.dat'
- 2D charge differences '2D_charge_diff_ab.dat' where ab is either xy, xz, or yz.
- 1D charge differences '1D_charge_diff_a.dat' where a is either x, y, or z;
